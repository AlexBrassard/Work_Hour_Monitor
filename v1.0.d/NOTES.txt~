Very Important:
Note: Choices? Yea.. what choices?
      Whm will support both long and short options.
      Options that has their arguments are surrounded by double square brackets
      means the argument is optional, surrounded by single square brackets means a
      mandatory option.
      Options with a capital short name (ex: "-W, -P") cannot be by themselfs on the command line.
      (In the cases of "-W and -P", they must be preceded by "-a", else they will be ignored.
      The first options to be implemented are:
      -p  --print [company_name] [[month]]  ; Both options are present: Print the [company name] [[month]] hour sheet to stdout.
      	  	  		 	      Default: Print [company_name]'s latest hour sheet to stdout.
      -a  --add                      	    ; CAN be used by itself (interactive mode).
				              When NOT followed by any -P or -W options: Add's an entry for [company_name]
      	  	  			      into the main configuration file and prompt user to enter the occupied positions
					      and the obtained wage for each of them.
					      When '-a, -P and -W' appear on the command line, an entry for [company name]
					      is created, including an entry for [position_name] and its associated [wage].
					      If [company_name] exists and '-a' was used alone, the entry is left untouched.
					      If [company_name] exists and '-P and -W' also appear on the command line,
					      if the -P [position_name] exists it's updated with [wage] value, else
					      and entry for [position_name] is created.
      -r  --remove [main|sheet]		    ; MUST be the only non upper-cased option on the command line.
      	  	   			      If no other options follows [main|sheet] on the command line,
					      -r main                             Removes the main configuration file.
					      -r sheet                            Removes ALL hour sheets.
					      -r -N company_name                  Removes company_name's entry from main config.
					      -r -N company_name -P position_name Removes the position_name's entry of 
					      	    		    		  company_name from main config.
                                              -r -N company_name -M month	  Removes the month sheet of company_name.
					      -r -N company_name -Y year          Removes all year sheets of company_name.
					      (-M and -Y can be combined to remove a precise hour sheet.)
					      [More to come as I think of them.]
      -u  --update			    ; CAN be used by itself (interactive mode).
      	  				      By default updates all hour sheets of active companies, overwritting
					      those that has been already filled, for the current day.
					      If '-a' is present, updates only the given date of the latest hour sheet.
					      If used with the '-N' option, interactively updates only the [company_name]
					      hour sheet, overwritting any existing value for the current day.
					      If used with the '-N -P' options, interactively updates only the [position_name]
					      of the given [company_name].
					      
      -N  --name  [company_name]            ; Useless by itself.
      	  	  			      Records a company name.
      -P  --pos   [position_name]           ; Useless by itself.
					      Records a position name.
      -W  --wage  [wage]		    ; Useless by itself.
      	  	  			      Records a wage.
      -D  --day   [day]                     ; Useless by itself.
      	  	  			      Records a day number.
      -M  --month [month]                   ; Useless by itself.
      	  	  			      Records a month number.
      -Y  --year  [year]                    ; Useless by itself.
      	  	  			      Records a year number.


Very Important:
Note: Keep traces.
      Backup the main configuration file and all hour sheets that gets
      opened before any editing takes place. The names of backups must be kept throught
      the entire life of the process and be removed only when the edited files have been
      successfuly written out to disk.

Old or Completed Notes:

Very Important: [DONE]
Note: Keep it or remake it.
      Both functions _read and _update_hour_sheet needs to be completely rewritten or
      needs some serious revamping. The function _read_hour_sheet must be split in
      many smaller parts making it much easier to update and modify the logic if needs
      arise. Compare Harvey_Inox and SLB hour sheets to further investigate what's
      wrong with the actual logic.

      : Completely rewritten functions _update/read/write_hour_sheets and main_config.
