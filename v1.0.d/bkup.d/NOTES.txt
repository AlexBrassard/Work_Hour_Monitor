      Both functions _read and _update_hour_sheet needs to be completely rewritten or

      many smaller parts making it much easier to update and modify the logic if needs
      arise. Compare Harvey_Inox and SLB hour sheets to further investigate what's
      wrong with the actual logic.


Very Important:
Note: Keep traces.
      Backup the main configuration file and all hour sheets that gets
      opened before any editing takes place. The names of backups must be kept throught
      the entire life of the process and be removed only when the edited files have been
      successfuly written out to disk.
