Main work_hour_monitor program:

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  Try to fopen the WHM_WORK_DIR
  If it failed,
    Call _create_work_dir.
  Check once more that we can read WHM_WORK_DIR,
  Fail hard if it's not possible.
  Else close the stream.

  From the WHM_WORK_DIR and the WHM_MAINCONF_NAME constants,
  whm_catslash a configuration filename and
  Call whm_read_main_config() to read the configuration file.

  When the whm_job_info_T array is ready,
  Call _handle_options to handle all passed command line options.

  If the program hasn't terminated via options,
  go through each elements of the whm_job_info_T array,
    Open the job's working directory or
    Call _create_company_dir if it didn't exists.
    Find the current month's hour sheet or
    Call _create_hour_sheet if it didn't exists.
    Check if the entry(ies) for the current day are filled,
    exit if yes.
    Prompt the user for the number of hours worked for all positions of the current job
    for the current day.
    Call _update_hour_sheet.
    Close the file.
    Close the job's working directory.

  Free all used memory,
  Return 0.

} /* main() */


Create the program's main working directory if it doesn't exists.

int whm_create_work_dir(char *dirname)
{
  If dirname is NULL,
    Set errno to EINVAL
    and return -1.

  Try to open dirname,
  If it succeed return WHM_DIREXISTS.
  else use mkdir to create the dirname directory.
  Make sure it succeed and if yes,
  return 0.
  else
  return errno.

} /* whm_create_work_dir() */

  
int whm_handle_options(int argc, char **argv)
{
  If argc is smaller or equal to 1 or argv is NULL
    Set errno to EINVAL and return -1.
  Use getopt() to handle options.
  Any unknown options should print the help message.
  Return 0 on success.

} /* whm_handle_options() */


int whm_create_main_config(char *filename)
{
  Check if the given filename is null.
  Set errno to EINVAL and return -1 if so.
  Look into WHM_WORK_DIR if filename exists
  (or directly try to open filename if it's an absolute pathname.)
  If it exists,
    Set errno to WHM_CONFEXISTS.
    return errno.

  Create filename with permission 0600
  and open it for writing.
  Print the main configuration header message.
  Ask the user informations regarding company(ies)
  that will appear in the configuration file.

  Print informations to filestream one job at a time
  configuration file.
  Close the filestream.

  Return 0;

} /* whm_create_main_config() */


Returns an array of whm_job_info_T containing all infos related to jobs read from the
main configuration file, also update the value of a pointer to it's first free element's index.

whm_job_info_T** whm_read_main_config(char *filename, size_t *first_free_element)
{
  whm_job_info_T **job_array = NULL;

  If filename is NULL set errno to EINVAL and return -1.
  Check that filename exists and if not create it using _create_main_config().
  Initialize a whm_stack_T stack of WHM_MAX_ENTRIES size.
  Open filename in read-only mode.
  Loop over each characters of the configuration file content.
  Everything from a '/*' sequence to a '*/' sequence  or terminating NUL byte
  is considered a commentary.
  The first string to be pushed on the stack should be the status string,
  which is 0 when the company is inactive, 1 when active.
  If this field is set to 0, skip every characters untill 3 consecutive newlines or
  the end of string is found.
  Characters are copied to a temporary string one at a time
  until a newline is found, which is the signal to push the string on
  the stack.
  When 3 consecutive newlines are found,
    the current job_array[] struct must be filled by poping the elements
    out of the stack in the proper order.
    job_array's index must be incremented.

  When the loop completes,
  Return job_array.

} /* whm_read_main_config() */


This function does not do any backup before deleting and creating
the main configuration file.
int whm_write_main_config(char *filename, whm_job_info_T **job_array)
{
  Verify parameters.
  If filename exists, delete it.
  Create filename and print the file header to the filestream.
  For each objects in job_array,
  print the information to the filestream
  Close the stream.
  Return 0.

} /* whm_write_main_config() */
  
Function called when the -a option is used on the command line.

int whm_add_to_config(whm_job_info_T **job_array, size_t *numof_elements)
{
  Backup the main configuration file.
  Use whm_read_main_config() to read the main configuration file and see if
  enough room is left for one more active entry,
  Ask the user all information needed to fill in the new job_info_T object.
  Use whm_write_main_config() to save the new entry in the configuration file.

} /* whm_add_to_config() */

Function called when the -r option is used on the command line.

int whm_del_from_config(char *job_name)
{
  Backup the main configuration file.
  Read the main configuration file using whm_read_main_config().
  Loop over each elements of the job_info_T array and look for the
  name given by the option's argument.
  Reset all fields of this object.
  Rearrange the array of job_info_T.
  Use whm_write_main_config to save the configuration file.

} /* whm_del_from_config() */


Function called when the -s option is used on the command line.
int whm_set_company_status(char *job_name, int status)
{
  Make sure job_name isn't null else set errno to EINVAL.

  Backup the main configuration file.
  Read the main configuration file using whm_read_main_config().
  Loop over each elements of the job_info_T array and look for the
  job name given by the option's argument.
  When found, set the status field of this job to status.
  Use whm_write_main_config() to create the new configuration file.
  Remove the backup file.
  return 0;

} /* whm_set_company_status() */


Print a header to the main configuration file.
void whm_main_config_header(FILE *filestream)
{
  Print a pretty header to the given stream.

} /* whm_main_config_header() */


int whm_create_company_dir(char *dirname)
{
  Set errno to EINVAL if dirname is NULL.

  If the directory already exists,
    Set errno to WHM_DIREXISTS
    and return it.

  Use mkdir() to create the requested directory.
  return 0;
} /* whm_create_company_dir() */


Create an hour sheet with all fields set to zeros.
int whm_create_hour_sheet(whm_job_info_T *job, char *time_string)
{
  Make sure job isn't NULL.

  Fetch the date.
  Make sure no hour sheet already exists for the current month.
  Create one in write mode with permission 0600
  Use the WHM_PRINT_SHEET_HEADER to print the header message of the new hour sheet.
  Use the WHM_PRINT_EMPTY_SHEET macro to print the empty sheet to
  the new file_stream.
  Close the stream.
  Return 0;

} /* whm_create_hour_sheet() */

Read the given worksheet and returns all informations contained within
the hour sheet in an array of whm_week_T data type.
whm_week_T** whm_read_hour_sheet(char *sheetpath, whm_job_info_T *job_info)
{
  Make sure sheetpath and job_info aren't NULL.
  Try to open sheetpath, it we fail to read it set errno to WHM_CANTREADSHEET
  and return NULL;

  We need a line count, line number 2, (1 being the "week number" line), needs to be
  proccessed a little differently:
  the 4 last strings pushed on that stack must be poped but not stored.

  Put all non-space/newline characters into a temporary string that will be pushed on
  the local stack_T once a space/newline character happen to be found.
  When reaching a newline character, the week_T structure must be updated with the
  stacked week's information.
  Once all 5 week objects of this month are filled,
  we can use the week_T array itself to fill the structs' remaining fields.

  When all fields of the array's structures are filled with values read from the given hour sheet,
  return the array itself to the caller.

} /* whm_read_hour_sheet() */


Update the given whm_week_T object, gotten from a previous call to _read_hour_sheet,
with values obtained either interactively by prompting the user for answers or via
command line options.
whm_week_T** whm_update_hour_sheet(whm_week_T **old, char *date_string,
	     		           char **hours_worked)
{
  Make sure old isn't NULL else fail with errno set to EINVAL.

  Remember that month dates start at 1 to max 31, while arrays goes
  from 0 to 30.

  For each positions of the current date, enter the proper values into
  the ->daily_info->pos_hours[], calculate the amount of money earned for the position,
  add all values of the ->->pos_hours[] array and update the ->->d_total_hours field, and
  add the amount of money earned from all positions to update the ->->d_total_cash field.
  Update the daynum and dayname fields.
  Return the modified object.

} /* whm_update_hour_sheet() */


Print the given hour sheet to stdout.

{
  return printf("%s\n", content);
} /* whm_display_hour_sheet() */

int whm_backup_hour_sheet(char *content, char *filename)

  Concatenate '.bkup' at the end of filename.
  write content to filename.bkup, overwritting
  any previous bkup file of the same name.

  Return 0;

Takes the current date and week day and return which
week day (sunday to saturday) the first of the month is/was
in the form of an enum, representing the corresponding string in
the constant array WHM_FR_WEEK_DAYS[][]
whm_wday_T whm_find_first_dom(char *weekday, int date)
{
  Make sure weekday isn't NULL and date is between 1 and 31.
  Make a counter that will decrement from 6 to 0 inclusively,
  restarting to 6 everytime it gets to -1,
  day 0 begin sunday, 6 saturday.
  The counter begins at the value of the given weekday, and
  will determine the weekday of the first of the month.
  Starting at the given date, we substract 1 until we reach 1,
  and then return the counter.
