Important
Note: Ignore any comments your hear, but remember all of them just in case:
    Since the configuration file should not be edited by hand,
    the position of commentaries and the comments themselfs should not
    be recorded but it will be very required for operations on hour sheets.



Note: Install me properly:
    The installation script needs to be reworked. First, a makefile must be created
    to handle everything related to program's compilation.
    The install script should interactively create (with the option to do it automaticaly)
    the 'whm_sysdep.h' file, which is mostly system/user dependent pathnames.


Mixed Notes:
  - Use fgets to read one line at a time.
  - The configuration file should not be edited by hand.
  - No streams should be passed through functions.
  - A separate header should be made for all values (pathnames)
    a user must set at the program installation.
    The installation script will create this file and prompt the
    user for all required system specific values.
  - Make sure it's easy to add more options.
  - The function to read hour sheets should not depend directly on sheet_T->numof_positions.
    It should know when the configuration file has changed and should be able to reflect
    these changes.
  - Every run:
    . Check if the .whm.d directory exist.
    . Check if the configuration file exist and is valid.
    . Read the configuration file, populating internal structure.
    . Fetch the current date.
    . Check that each company found in the configuration file has an existing working directory.
    . Check that the current year directory exists for each company.
    . Check that the hour sheet for the current month for each company exist.
    . Backup all required hour sheets.
    . Read all required hour sheets.
    . Check for and execute command line options (not executing the next points).
    . When no options were passed, interactively update all non-filled hour sheets.
    . Write all updated hour sheets.
    . Delete all hour sheet backups.
    . Free all memory and exit.
  - Options are: ((): non required options.)
    . -p  --print  [name()] [year()] [month()]			Print an hour sheet to stdout.
    . -u  --update [name()] [position()] [hours()] [date()]	Update a company's hour sheet.
    . -a  --add    (fully interactive) 		 		Add a company to the configuration file.
    . -d  --delete [name()]					Delete a company from the configuration file.
    . -m  --modify [name()] [position()] [field()] [value()]	Modify an existing entry in the configuration file.
    . -l  --list   						Print a list of the companies names in the configuration file.
    . -h  --help  						Print a short help message.

The idea:
    Work Hour Monitor will prompt its users at least once a day
    for the number of hours worked.
    A configuration file will be used
    to store information about tracked companies, and use this
    info to create, once a month, an hour sheet for that company
    for that month.
    WHM should expect all of the content of the ~/.whm.d/ directory
    to be edited by hand and should reflect these changes the next
    time it's run.
    All files within the ~/.whm.d/ directory should be editable
    interactively within WHM or directly from switches on the command line.
    WHM will calculate the amount of hours and money made for each active
    company in the configuration file.
    WHM should expect that the number of parameters that influence a salary
    can vary and it should be built so it's easy to add/remove any.
