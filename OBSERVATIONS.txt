	- Using Harvey_Inox, trying to change the position "operateur", mistakenly
	  input "Operateur" and inter_modify() returned : Cannot convert non-digit chars to unsigned ints.

	  Solution: No checks were made on "value[0]" to make sure it's not a NULL byte.


	- I suspect a race condition in whm_inter_modify_config() or whm_modify_config().
	  I ran the program (function_tester), company name: Harvey_Inox (the 2nd config entry),
	  when using the "list" command the program just hangs forever.
	  Using gdb, I found the hanging starts at strcmp().
	  When trying to list the fields of SLB (the first config entry) it works perfectly.

	  Solution: "c_ind" wasn't being incremented at each end of loop, hence hanging forever
	  	    for any company that wasn't at position 0 in the configuration file.
