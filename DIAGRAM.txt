[1] whm_parse_option
we're expecting the form "-o || --longopt arg_name=value"
(short or long option name followed by the argument's name and value in one string.)
For each option name, make sure it's valid and use
whm_get_args() to fetch its arguments.
The operations are sorted in importance order, which is why the order of the
enum whm_option_names data types' members is important. Element 0 of the
said data type is the most important while the last is the least important.
Depending on the option's operation field, execute the appropriate operation
(whm_*_op functions from whm_main.c).

whm_get_args splits each argument's name from its value and convert the value
to the appropriate data type to then be saved in the whm_option_T object of the
current option.
Arguments' names are in WHM_ARG_NAMES[] (whm.h) and a corresponding enum whm_optarg_type data type
is made available to ease access to the arrays' members.
